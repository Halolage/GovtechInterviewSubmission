Section 1

Python file transformation.py created to address the read of csv files, main transformation of data, and write back to output folder.

CRON scheduling cannot be used because I am using windows machine, so opted for windows task scheduler instead. Set up is in local and attached a screenshot in misc_screenshot_section_1 folder. Tested at 1am on 19th June 2022 it is triggered fine. 

As for the processed input dataset, I have changed slightly on dataset2.csv file to add prepended zeros on price. dataset1.csv does not have missing names, so input count is equal to output count. Whereas dataset2.csv is lesser because it is being cleaned for missing names.
